# CFB2019RScraper
R script that grabs offensive game logs for every D1 CFB team and stores in respective CSV files

This script isn't perfect by any stretch, but each file will be scraped for the 2019 season and named "offense(team)2019.csv". Each table includes the offensive gamelog data found at https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/alabama/2019/gamelog/. Next steps will be reiterating this for past seasons and including the defensive gamelogs as well.

This is my first piece of working code so be easy on me!

Thanks, and enjoy. This was created for running quick calculations to try to keep an edge with betting on the 2020 college football season so I'm open to a lot of input regarding incorporating odds or other gambling data.
